Snowflake (Arctic),snowflake-arctic,3.35," Based on the context information provided, the beef and rice with mushroom sauce contains the following nutritional values per serving:

- Calories: 135 kcal
- Protein: 6.25g
- Carbs: 15.53g
- Fat: 4.76g
- Fiber: 0.4g

To calculate the nutritional values for 100g of the dish, we can set up proportions:

- Calories: (135 kcal / serving) * (100g / 1 serving) = 135 kcal/serving * 100g = 135 kcal
- Protein: (6.25g / serving) * (100g / 1 serving) = 6.25g/serving * 100g = 62.5g
- Carbs: (15.53g / serving) * (100g / 1 serving) = 15.53g/serving * 100g = 155.3g
- Fat: (4.76g / serving) * (100g / 1 serving) = 4.76g/serving * 100g = 47.6g
- Fiber: (0.4g / serving) * (100g / 1 serving) = 0.4g/serving * 100g = 4g

Meta (Llama 3.1 70B),llama3.1-70b,9.69,"To find the exact values of protein, calories, carbs, and fat in 100g of pizza cheese whole wheat thin crust, we need to look at the corresponding values for that specific food item.

According to the context information, for pizza cheese whole wheat thin crust:

* Calories: 267 kcal
* Protein: 11.77g
* Carbs: 28.62g
* Fat: 10.87g

However, these values are not for 100g, so we need to calculate the values for 100g.

To calculate the values for 100g, we need to know the weight of the serving size for pizza cheese whole wheat thin crust. Unfortunately, the context information does not provide this information.

Assuming a standard serving size for pizza is around 250-300g, we can estimate the values for 100g. However, please note that this is an approximation.

For a serving size of 267 kcal, let's assume it's approximately 250g. Then, for 100g, we can calculate the values as follows:

* Calories: 267 kcal / 250g * 100g ≈ 106.8 kcal
* Protein: 11.77g / 250g * 100g ≈ 4.71g
