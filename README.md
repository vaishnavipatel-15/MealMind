## 🏗️ System Architecture & Design

### System Architecture
![Basic System Architecture](Images/Basic%20System%20Architecture.png)
The application follows a modern three-tier architecture with a Streamlit frontend, Python backend for business logic, and Snowflake as the data warehouse. This design ensures scalability, maintainability, and efficient data processing for nutrition intelligence.

### Data Flow & ELT Pipeline
![Data Flow & ELT](Images/Data%20Flow%20_%20ELT.png)
Our Extract, Load, Transform (ELT) pipeline leverages Snowflake's computing power to process USDA nutrition data efficiently. Raw data is loaded into staging tables, then transformed using dbt models to create analytics-ready datasets for meal planning and nutritional analysis.

### User Onboarding Flow
